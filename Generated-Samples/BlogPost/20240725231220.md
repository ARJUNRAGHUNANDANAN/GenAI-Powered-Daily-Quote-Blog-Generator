> Amidst the celestial tapestry, we gleam,
Like moonlit paths and stellar beams.
Each soul a cosmos, radiant and bright,
Reflecting the universe's guiding light.

In darkness profound, our spirits ignite,
A beacon of hope, a beacon of light.
Like stars twinkling in the vast expanse,
We illuminate the world with our dance.

Like the sun, we blaze, a golden hue,
Nurturing dreams, making purpose anew.
In unity, we shine, a celestial whole,
Each soul a spark, illuminating the scroll.
