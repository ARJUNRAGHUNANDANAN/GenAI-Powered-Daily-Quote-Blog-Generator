> Like sunshine after rain,
They come to us in need,
They stoke our inner flame,
And plant a fertile seed.

With words of hope and cheer,
They lift us from the ground,
They help us face our fear,
And in ourselves, they help us to be found.

So let us give them thanks,
For all the help they give,
They are the ones who help us,
To truly start to live.
