> **If we could learn**

If we could learn to love ourselves,
Even a little, just a spark,
Our cruelties and angers might melt away,
Like snow beneath the sun's warm mark.

The harshness in our hearts would soften,
Our judgments fade into the past,
For in self-love, true healing lies,
A balm for wounds that long have cast.

Like flowers turning towards the light,
We'd bloom with kindness, sweet and bright,
If we could learn to like ourselves,
The darkness would dissolve, we'd find release.
