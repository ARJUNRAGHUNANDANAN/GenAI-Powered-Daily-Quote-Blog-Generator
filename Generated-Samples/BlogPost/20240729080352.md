> In the present's embrace, the future takes form,
For those who dance with life's eternal charm.
Alan Watts' wisdom, a timeless decree,
No plans can flourish without living freely.

Ignite the spark within, embrace each breath,
For life unfolds its tapestry beneath.
The past is gone, the future yet unknown,
The present is the canvas on which our dreams are sown.

Seize the moment's grace, let your spirit soar,
Dream, create, and live with passion's roar.
No distant goals can guide without a present's fire,
Ignite your life, and let your soul inspire.
