## Intuition is the supra-logic that cuts out all the routine processes of thought and leaps straight from the problem to the answer.

> Leaping from the logic's chains,
Intuition's path remains,
Straight to the answer's heart,
A spark that sets us apart.

Through the maze of thought, it guides,
A swift and sure stride,
Cutting through the mental fog,
To the clarity of the bog.

Unraveling the tangled threads,
Intuition gently spreads,
Whispering secrets in our ear,
Guiding us with crystal clear.
