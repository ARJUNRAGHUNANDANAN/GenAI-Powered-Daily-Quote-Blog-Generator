> In realms of time, where choices unseen,
We forge our paths, our joys convene.
Long before sorrows come to play, 
Our choices dance, our hearts they sway.

Like threads of fate, our actions bind,
Creating destinies, both firm and kind.
Each thread we weave, a tapestry's art,
Unveiling joys and sorrows in our heart.

The colors bright, the hues serene,
Reflect the choices that we've been.
In every choice, a lesson gleams,
Shaping our lives, fulfilling our dreams.
