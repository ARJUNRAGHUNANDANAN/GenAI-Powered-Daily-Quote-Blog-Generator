> Beware of wisdom that's a guise,
For false knowledge often lies.
More treacherous than ignorance,
It leads one down a path of trance.

Trust not in words that seem to gleam,
But seek the truth, dispelling the dream.
Question and doubt, do not assume,
Unveiling truths in knowledge's gloom.

Wisdom's path is paved with care,
Distinguishing truth from the snare.
Embrace the journey, question all,
Unveiling wisdom's sacred call.
