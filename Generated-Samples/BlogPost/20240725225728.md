> In dreams' embrace, a future bright,
For those who dare, with all their might.
With faith as guide, they soar and roam,
Eleanor's words, a beacon in their dome.

Like eagles soaring, wings unfurled,
They chase their aspirations, wide and whirled.
The canvas of their dreams, vibrant and bold,
With colors of hope, a story yet untold.

Dreams, the seeds of progress sown,
Nurtured by belief, like flowers grown.
In their hearts, a flame burns bright,
Guiding them forward, through day and night.
