> In the tapestry of life, where threads intertwine,
Friendship's embrace heals depths of the soul divine.
A balm for the wounded, a beacon of hope,
Love's gentle touch mends hearts, restores life's scope.

Like sunlight piercing shadows, dispelling the gray,
Friendship's rays illuminate, guiding our way.
A sanctuary where secrets safely reside,
Where laughter and tears flow side by side.

In love's embrace, we find solace and grace,
A sanctuary where wounds find a safe space.
With unwavering support, it steadies our stride,
A constant companion, forever by our side.

So let us embrace the greatest healing therapy found,
In the depths of friendship and love's profound.
For these bonds mend the broken, make us whole,
Guiding us through life's journey, filling our soul.
