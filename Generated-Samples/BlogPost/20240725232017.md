> The value of comprehension clear,
In understanding's gentle sphere.
A little light, dispelling doubt,
Outshines a vast but darkened route.

Misconceptions cloud and lead astray,
A maze of errors, gone astray.
Better to grasp a truth, though small,
Than in illusions blindly fall.

Wisdom's path, with insight graced,
Unravels truths we once embraced.
A little knowledge, wisely sought,
Illuminates a path, a precious thought.
