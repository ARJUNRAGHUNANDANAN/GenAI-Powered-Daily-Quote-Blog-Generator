> In slumber's embrace, the weary find,
Renewal's touch, where dreams unwind.
Like fallow fields that patiently wait,
Rest grants respite, to regenerate.

A thirsty soul, in respite's hold,
Rejuvenates, a story yet untold.
For in the pause, where silence reigns,
Strength gathers, like a gentle rains.

The path ahead, though arduous and steep,
With rested hearts, we'll conquer every heap.
For tired minds and bodies yearn,
For moments still, where peace can turn.
