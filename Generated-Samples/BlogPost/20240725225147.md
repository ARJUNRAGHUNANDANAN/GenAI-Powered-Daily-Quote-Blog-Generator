> In the realm of knowledge, a treasure untold,
Intuition's whisper, a guiding fold.
Einstein's insight, a beacon so bright,
Beyond logic's grasp, it sheds its light.

In the depths of our being, intuition resides,
A compass within, where wisdom abides.
It steers us through life's uncertain storms,
Unveiling truths in elusive forms.

Like a gentle breeze that whispers secrets untold,
Intuition's voice, a tapestry to unfold.
It weaves a web of insights and dreams,
Leading us towards our destined gleams.
