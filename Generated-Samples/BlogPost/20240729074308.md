> Deep within your timid soul,
Awaits the path to make you whole.
Unveiling strengths you never knew,
Embrace the fears that haunt you through.

In shadows veiled, a treasure lies,
Courage blooming as you rise.
Each step you take, a victory won,
As fear's grip loosens, light begun.

So heed the call, confront your dread,
Unlock the power within your tread.
For in the face of what you fear,
Lies growth and liberation clear.
