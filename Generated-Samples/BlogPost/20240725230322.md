> The weight of expectations,
A burden on our souls,
When we strive to be someone else,
We lose our inner toll.

Unveiling our true selves,
A journey to embrace,
No longer bound by societal shelves,
We find our rightful place.

Being someone, not something,
A choice that sets us free,
Inherent worth, our souls humming,
Authenticity, our destiny.
